## Requirements

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require superbig/craft-audit

## Audit Overview

Audit automatically keeps an audit log for actions done by logged in users.

## Configuring Audit

```php
<?php
return [
    // How many days to keep log entries around
    'pruneDays'          => 30,

    // Enable logging
    'enabled'            => true,

    // Toggle specific event types
    'logElementEvents'            => true,
    'logDraftEvents'              => false,
    'logPluginEvents'             => true,
    'logUserEvents'               => true,
    'logRouteEvents'              => true,

    
    // Prune old records when a admin is logged in
    'pruneRecordsOnAdminRequests'          => false,

    // Enable geolocation status
    'enabledGeolocation' => true,
    
    // Where to save Maxmind DB files
    'dbPath' => '',
];
```

## Using Audit

As long as the plugin is installed, it will log the following events automatically:

- Creating/saving/deleting elements (including users, Commerce product/variants etc.)
- Saving global sets
- Creating/saving/deleting routes
- Installing/uninstalling and enabling/disabling plugins
- Login/logout

More events like Commerce-specific event handling is planned.

## Clearing old records

You can prune records older than `n` days (configured by the `pruneDays` setting) either by using the console command `./craft audit/default/prune-logs` or by a button on the Audit index screen.
